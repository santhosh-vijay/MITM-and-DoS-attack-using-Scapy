# MITM-and-DoS-attack-using-Scapy

Objective:
To simulate a Man in the Middle (MitM) attack and Denial of Service (DoS) attack between two Linux systems on VMware workstation. One Linux system will be a Web Server and another system will be a Client trying to access the web page of that server. A separate Linux system will be the attacker hosting and executing Docker containers that will contain the required python scripts to perform the attack. The Network adapter type should be in "host" mode on all the Linux virtual machines including the attacker's machine.
